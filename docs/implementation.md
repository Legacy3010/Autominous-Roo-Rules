# Implementation Update — Autonomous Process + Memory I/O

Timestamp: 2025-08-14 12:19:31 BST
Mode: code

## Summary
- Enhanced [Rules.MD](Rules.MD:1) with a strict end-to-end process pipeline, explicit memory I/O paths, standardized blocks (ASSUMPTION, HANDOFF), minimal-question policy, and per-mode contracts.
- Aligned [allmodes.txt](allmodes.txt:1) with Rules by embedding:
  - Per-mode Memory I/O (what each mode must read/write)
  - Standardized HANDOFF and ASSUMPTION logging
  - Autonomy-first execution (derive, assume safely, proceed, log)
  - Snapshot/rollback guardrails prior to high-risk operations

## Files Changed
- [Rules.MD](Rules.MD:1)
- [allmodes.txt](allmodes.txt:1)

## Key Additions (Rules.MD)
- Process Pipeline (applies to every action):
  1) Intake → 2) Hydrate Context (past/present/future) → 3) Environment Scan (refresh project_tree) → 4) Plan (validate paths) → 5) Act (one tool) → 6) Record (context/logs/status) → 7) Validate (route to test/security) → 8) Snapshot (every 3 actions or drift) → 9) Loop Guard.
- Minimal-Question Policy:
  - Ask only for irreversible/destructive choices that cannot be inferred.
  - Prefer safe defaults; proceed and log assumptions.
- Standard Blocks:
  - ASSUMPTION block format for context_log.md
  - HANDOFF block format for active_context.md and mode_switches.log
- Memory I/O structure:
  - Base: <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/
  - Context: context_log.md (past), active_context.md (present), future_context.md (future)
  - Status/Logs: checklist.md, task_history.log, issues.md, test_outcomes.md, security_audit.md, snapshots/
- Enforcement:
  - Append-only logging to status/logs/context with timestamps
  - Validate writes against context/project_tree.md
  - Snapshot cadence and emergency-mode escalation on repeated failures
- KPIs:
  - Autonomy %, time-to-completion, rework rate, snapshot vs. drift

## Key Alignments (allmodes.txt)
- Orchestrator:
  - Delegates with explicit scope and standardized HANDOFF
  - Enforces per-mode Memory I/O; triggers mode-contract-validator
- Code:
  - Validates target paths via project_tree.md
  - Snapshots before high-risk edits
  - Updates docs/implementation.md and checklist
- Architect:
  - Builds/refreshes project_tree.md
  - Writes docs/plan.md and todos (task-type: todo)
- Debug:
  - Hypothesis narrowing, targeted diagnostics, ASSUMPTION logging
- Test:
  - Ensures tests exist; records outcomes; routes failures to Debug
- Documentation/Research/Security/DevOps:
  - Each declares explicit read/write contracts to context/status/logs
- Mode-Contract Validator:
  - Verifies prior mode complied with reads/writes and logging

## Past / Present / Future Memory Flow
- Past: Append action outcomes to context/context_log.md
- Present: Summarize current scope/plan in context/active_context.md
- Future: Plan next hints/steps in context/future_context.md

## Safety & Rollback
- Snapshots written to .ai_coder/snapshots/state_TIMESTAMP.md every 3 actions or before risky operations.
- On two consecutive tool failures: escalate to emergency-mode and produce causal trace.

## Multi-Module Comprehension
- Uniform, parseable block formats (ASSUMPTION, HANDOFF, ACTION) so all modes and external agents can quickly sync state with minimal tokens.

## Next Operational Steps (recorded for orchestrator)
- Run mode-contract-validator to confirm Code changes were logged and contracts met.
- Route to test-mode if any executable changes occur in src/tests (not applicable for config-only edit).
- Report-mode to update KPIs after initial usage period.
