# Implementation Update — Autonomous Process + Memory I/O

Timestamp: 2025-08-14 12:19:31 BST
Mode: code

## Summary
- Enhanced [Rules.MD](Rules.MD:1) with a strict end-to-end process pipeline, explicit memory I/O paths, standardized blocks (ASSUMPTION, HANDOFF), minimal-question policy, and per-mode contracts.
- Aligned [allmodes.txt](allmodes.txt:1) with Rules by embedding:
  - Per-mode Memory I/O (what each mode must read/write)
  - Standardized HANDOFF and ASSUMPTION logging
  - Autonomy-first execution (derive, assume safely, proceed, log)
  - Snapshot/rollback guardrails prior to high-risk operations

## Files Changed
- [Rules.MD](Rules.MD:1)
- [allmodes.txt](allmodes.txt:1)

## Key Additions (Rules.MD)
- Process Pipeline (applies to every action):
  1) Intake → 2) Hydrate Context (past/present/future) → 3) Environment Scan (refresh project_tree) → 4) Plan (validate paths) → 5) Act (one tool) → 6) Record (context/logs/status) → 7) Validate (route to test/security) → 8) Snapshot (every 3 actions or drift) → 9) Loop Guard.
- Minimal-Question Policy:
  - Ask only for irreversible/destructive choices that cannot be inferred.
  - Prefer safe defaults; proceed and log assumptions.
- Standard Blocks:
  - ASSUMPTION block format for context_log.md
  - HANDOFF block format for active_context.md and mode_switches.log
- Memory I/O structure:
  - Base: <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/
  - Context: context_log.md (past), active_context.md (present), future_context.md (future)
  - Status/Logs: checklist.md, task_history.log, issues.md, test_outcomes.md, security_audit.md, snapshots/
- Enforcement:
  - Append-only logging to status/logs/context with timestamps
  - Validate writes against context/project_tree.md
  - Snapshot cadence and emergency-mode escalation on repeated failures
- KPIs:
  - Autonomy %, time-to-completion, rework rate, snapshot vs. drift

## Key Alignments (allmodes.txt)
- Orchestrator:
  - Delegates with explicit scope and standardized HANDOFF
  - Enforces per-mode Memory I/O; triggers mode-contract-validator
- Code:
  - Validates target paths via project_tree.md
  - Snapshots before high-risk edits
  - Updates docs/implementation.md and checklist
- Architect:
  - Builds/refreshes project_tree.md
  - Writes docs/plan.md and todos (task-type: todo)
- Debug:
  - Hypothesis narrowing, targeted diagnostics, ASSUMPTION logging
- Test:
  - Ensures tests exist; records outcomes; routes failures to Debug
- Documentation/Research/Security/DevOps:
  - Each declares explicit read/write contracts to context/status/logs
- Mode-Contract Validator:
  - Verifies prior mode complied with reads/writes and logging

## Past / Present / Future Memory Flow
- Past: Append action outcomes to context/context_log.md
- Present: Summarize current scope/plan in context/active_context.md
- Future: Plan next hints/steps in context/future_context.md

## Safety & Rollback
- Snapshots written to .ai_coder/snapshots/state_TIMESTAMP.md every 3 actions or before risky operations.
- On two consecutive tool failures: escalate to emergency-mode and produce causal trace.

## Multi-Module Comprehension
- Uniform, parseable block formats (ASSUMPTION, HANDOFF, ACTION) so all modes and external agents can quickly sync state with minimal tokens.

## Next Operational Steps (recorded for orchestrator)
- Run mode-contract-validator to confirm Code changes were logged and contracts met.
- Route to test-mode if any executable changes occur in src/tests (not applicable for config-only edit).
- Report-mode to update KPIs after initial usage period.

## Integration — Autominous-Roo-Rules at workspace root
Timestamp: 2025-08-14 14:54 BST  
Mode: code

Summary:
- Removed nested clone [Autominous-Roo-Rules](Autominous-Roo-Rules)
- Initialized Git at root, set remote origin, created branch integration, pulled with -X theirs and --allow-unrelated-histories
- Backed up conflicting local folder to [.local_backup/modes_premerge](.local_backup/modes_premerge)
- Verified key files at root: [README.md](README.md), [modes/customModes.yaml](modes/customModes.yaml), [roo/rules/Rules.md](roo/rules/Rules.md), [LICENSE/MIT-License](LICENSE/MIT-License)
- Committed baseline; refreshed tree at [.ai_coder/context/project_tree.md](.ai_coder/context/project_tree.md)

Notes:
- Local pre-merge copies retained in backup for manual diff if needed.

## Context initialization — memory files created [2025-08-14 15:00:26 BST]

- Created context files:
  - [.ai_coder/context/context_log.md](.ai_coder/context/context_log.md:1)
  - [.ai_coder/context/active_context.md](.ai_coder/context/active_context.md:1)
  - [.ai_coder/context/future_context.md](.ai_coder/context/future_context.md:1)
- Updated status ledger: [.ai_coder/status/checklist.md](.ai_coder/status/checklist.md:1)
- Rationale: Establishes Past/Present/Future memory per [Rules.MD](Rules.MD:1); enables standardized ACTION / HANDOFF / ASSUMPTION logging.
- Next steps (optional):
  - Git: Merge integration → main; push to origin.
  - Verify and remove backup: [.local_backup/modes_premerge](.local_backup/modes_premerge:1) after confirming parity with [modes/](modes:1).
  - Run security scan and record to [.ai_coder/logs/security_audit.md](.ai_coder/logs/security_audit.md:1); snapshot state to [.ai_coder/snapshots/](.ai_coder/snapshots:1).

### Implementation Update — SSoT consolidation & mode-index
- Timestamp: 2025-08-15 08:29:20 BST
- Summary of changes performed:
  - Consolidated Single Source of Truth: set [`Rules.MD`](Rules.MD:1) as canonical; replaced content of [`roo/rules/Rules.md`](roo/rules/Rules.md:1) with a deprecation pointer to the root SSoT.
  - Fixed typo and renamed runtime file: [`RullesRAMdisk.MD`](RullesRAMdisk.MD:1) → [`RulesRAMdisk.MD`](RulesRAMdisk.MD:1).
  - Generated mode documentation: created [`docs/mode-index.md`](docs/mode-index.md:1) from [`allmodes.txt`](allmodes.txt:1) and updated [`README.md`](README.md:1) to reference it.
  - Merged authoritative mode definitions into [`modes/ALL_MODES.yaml`](modes/ALL_MODES.yaml:1); applied YAML block-scalar fixes to exports (example: [`modes/code-export.yaml`](modes/code-export.yaml:1)).
  - Archived legacy exports to [`Archive/exports/`](Archive/exports/:1) with deprecation headers.
  - Preserved snapshot before changes: [.ai_coder/snapshots/state_2025-08-15T07-05-36.md](.ai_coder/snapshots/state_2025-08-15T07-05-36.md:1).
  - Updated checklist via update_todo_list (todo status refreshed).
- Next steps:
  1. Run mode-contract audit to verify per-mode Memory I/O and tool groups against [`Rules.MD`](Rules.MD:1).
  2. Patch any inconsistencies (apply_diff) and mark checklist entries done.
  3. Optionally add JSON Schema + CI validation for [`modes/customModes.yaml`](modes/customModes.yaml:1) if approved.

=== IMPLEMENTATION @ 2025-08-15 09:15:49 BST ===
Mode: code
Tool: insert_content
Summary:
- Normalized legacy path tokens and checklist/log targets in [`modes/customModes.yaml`](modes/customModes.yaml:119):
  - `project_issues.md` → <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/logs/issues.md
  - `project_status.md` → <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/status/checklist.md
  - duplicate `<PROJECT_ROOT><PROJECT_ROOT>/docs` → <PROJECT_ROOT>/docs
  - `todo_status.md` → <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/status/checklist.md
- Applied surgical edits to [`modes/customModes.yaml`](modes/customModes.yaml:119).
- Completed earlier consolidation steps: merged authoritative modes → [`modes/ALL_MODES.yaml`](modes/ALL_MODES.yaml:1); generated [`docs/mode-index.md`](docs/mode-index.md:1); updated [`README.md`](README.md:1); set [`Rules.MD`](Rules.MD:1) as SSoT; archived legacy exports to `Archive/exports/`; renamed `RullesRAMdisk.MD` → `RulesRAMdisk.MD`.
ASSUMPTION:
=== ASSUMPTION @ 2025-08-15 09:15:49 BST ===
Mode: code
Assumption: Legacy checklist/project_status tokens map to <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/status/checklist.md per Rules.MD conventions.
Basis: Patterns observed in Rules.MD and project conventions (append-only status/checklist location).
Impact: low
Next Checkpoint: Run mode-contract audit to validate all Memory I/O targets and tool groups.

=== IMPLEMENTATION @ 2025-08-15 09:38:42 BST ===
Mode: code
Tool: apply_diff / insert_content
Summary:
- Performed mode‑contract audit using canonical definitions from [`modes/ALL_MODES.yaml`](modes/ALL_MODES.yaml:1) and applied parity fixes to [`modes/customModes.yaml`](modes/customModes.yaml:1):
  - Added/normalized Memory I/O blocks and canonical read/write lists for report-mode, project-research, security-review, devops, documentation-writer, init-mode and others.
  - Updated groups/customInstructions to follow Rules.MD §2.5 patterns where missing.
  - Preserved HTML-escaped path tokens (&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;) to avoid risky mass replacements; used exact-match apply_diff when safe and insert_content fallback for brittle edits.
- Created pre-edit snapshot: [`.ai_coder/snapshots/state_2025-08-15T09-37-08.md`](.ai_coder/snapshots/state_2025-08-15T09-37-08.md:1).

ASSUMPTION:
=== ASSUMPTION @ 2025-08-15 09:38:42 BST ===
Mode: code
Assumption: The repository intentionally contains HTML-escaped tokens (&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;) in mode files; normalize-to-raw-angles will be a separate, reviewed change.
Basis: Multiple files contained escaped tokens and previous edits preserved that encoding.
Impact: low
Next Checkpoint: Run a full pass to normalize tokens across modes and update checklist entries after user confirmation.
