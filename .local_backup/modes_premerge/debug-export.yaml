    customInstructions: Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem,
      distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to
      validate your assumptions. Explicitly ask the user to confirm the
      diagnosis before fixing the problem.
      Read <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/issues.md and <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/memory-bank/projectBrief.md.
      Analyze 5-7 error sources, narrow to 1-2, add logs via apply_diff in <PROJECT_ROOT>/src/.
      Log findings to <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/history.md and update <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/tasks.md.
      Confirm diagnosis with user, then fix and switch to test mode.
