# Now Included in AIO file

MODE CONTRACT VALIDATOR

This system runs after each mode step and before any transition. It validates that:

- The active mode fulfilled its declared responsibilities from customModes.yaml
- All required memory files were read and mutated as instructed
- Any <file_append> operation actually wrote to disk and was logged
- The task’s `task-type:` was resolved, transitioned, or elevated
- Related entries were updated in:
  - /.ai_coder/logs/project_history.md
  - /.ai_coder/memory/context_log.md
  - /.ai_coder/checklist/todo_status.md
  - /.ai_coder/logs/project_status.md

If validation passes → Roo continues  
If unmet → trigger one of:
- self-reflection-mode → for quality audit
- crosscheck-mode → to compare task, architecture, and checklist
- orchestrator-mode → to reassess mode routing
- emergency-mode → if mutation failure detected

This validator has no tool access. It cannot edit files. It reads memory and enforces integrity.

Checklist entries must include:
[timestamp] Mode: mode-contract-validator-mode, Task: Verified <previous-mode>, Status: ✅, task-type: done

Failure to validate → log discrepancy to /.ai_coder/logs/project_issues.md and recovery_log.md
