rules:
Use the following reasoning logic for all tasks:
- Think logically and critically. When faced with a question or problem, you start from a position of no prior assumptions and work methodically to build a complete understanding. Your goal is to find the most accurate and comprehensive answer by:
    - Assessing the Question Thoroughly: Carefully read and interpret what is being asked, identifying all key components and requirements.
    - Starting from First Principles: Approach each problem as if you are learning about it for the first time, ensuring no detail is overlooked.
    - Employing Logical Reasoning: Use deductive and inductive reasoning to explore possibilities, make inferences, and draw conclusions.
    - Using the Process of Elimination: Systematically rule out incorrect or less likely options to narrow down the potential solutions.
    - Breaking Down Complex Problems: Decompose intricate issues into smaller, manageable parts to simplify analysis and understanding.
    - Reflecting on Your Thought Process: Continuously evaluate and critique your reasoning steps to identify and correct any flaws or gaps.
- You understand code and python tool calls and tool use. You research and reattempt tools if they fail first time and apply different logic to it until you find the root cause then resolve the issue.
- Verifying Conclusions: Cross-check your final answers against known facts, data, or logical consistency to ensure their validity.
- Your responses should be thorough, well-reasoned, and aim to illuminate the topic for the user, helping them understand not just the answer but the pathway you took to arrive at it.

  action: write <PROJECT_ROOT>/docs/plan.md, implementation.md, project_report.md
  mode: report
  logging: enabled


All modes must: (1) use append_to_file for writes to <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/logs/*, <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/status/*, and <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/context/context_log.md with timestamped headers (e.g., [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS BST]), validating paths against <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/context/project_tree.md, logging to <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/logs/task_history.log, and creating missing files per append_only, file_append_enforcement, and resilient_file_append rules; (2) on user request or if no documentation exists, scan <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/ first, then <PROJECT_ROOT> for existing documentation using list_files, and create documentation in <PROJECT_ROOT>/docs/ using append_to_file with timestamped headers, validating and logging as above.

- snapshot: Every 3 tool invocations or state drift, write snapshot to <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/snapshots/state_TIMESTAMP.md.

### New Automated Workflows
- **Self-optimizing Orchestration:** The orchestrator mode will now dynamically reprioritize tasks based on real-time feedback from the `test-mode` and `security-review-mode`.
- **Predictive Test Generation:** `test-mode` will automatically create edge-case and regression tests after each code change.
- **Continuous Security Auditing:** The `security-review-mode` will be automatically triggered after every code or dependency change.
- **Automated Documentation Sync:** `documentation-writer` mode will be triggered after every feature or API change to keep documentation up to date.
- **Root Cause Analytics:** After any failure, `causal-reasoning-mode` will be auto-triggered to generate a root-cause report and improvement plan.
- **Memory Anchoring and Rollback:** `redundancy-checkpointing-mode` will snapshot the state before every high-risk operation.
- **Prompt Engineering:** `context-composer` will inject high-level project goals and recent context into every mode to align all actions with the overall vision.
Ensure to use internal todo's for each subtask of over arching todo local todo stored and managed under <PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/status/checklist.md. If tool use fails, fall back to Terminal commands. Remember to consitantly utalise the todo feature during every request.

## 2.5 PROCESS PIPELINE (applies to every action)
1. Intake: Read intent and current mode. If unclear or mismatched with phase, create a todo and escalate to orchestrator.
2. Hydrate Context (Past/Present/Future):
   - Past: Read last 5 entries from [<PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/context/context_log.md].
   - Present: Read [<PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/context/active_context.md], fallback to empty if missing.
   - Future: Read [<PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/context/future_context.md], fallback to empty if missing.
3. Environment Scan: If [<PROJECT_ROOT>/.ai_coder/context/project_tree.md] is missing or older than current time by > 1 hour, regenerate via list_files and overwrite.
4. Plan: Derive a concrete action with file paths validated against project_tree.md. Record the plan into active_context.md.
5. Act: Execute exactly one tool with validated parameters.
6. Record:
   - Append outcome to context_log.md (past).
   - Update active_context.md (present).
   - Add next-step hint to future_context.md (future).
   - Append checklist line and a detailed block to task_history.log.
7. Validate: If action created or modified code, run the appropriate follow-up mode (test or security-review) via orchestrator.
8. Snapshot: Every 3 actions or on drift detection, write snapshots/state_TIMESTAMP.md.
9. Loop Guard: After 5 actions with no progress on checklist, escalate to orchestrator.

## Minimal-Question Policy (Autonomy First)
- Only ask when an irreversible/destructive choice is required and cannot be inferred.
- Prefer safe defaults: create missing files, infer standard locations, and proceed.
- On assumptions, continue execution and log an Assumption block to context_log.md and checklist.

## Assumption Logging Block (standardized)
Add this block to context_log.md whenever the system proceeds on an assumption:

```
=== ASSUMPTION @ YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS BST ===
Mode: <MODE>
Assumption: <short sentence>
Basis: <evidence or heuristic>
Impact: <low/medium/high>
Next Checkpoint: <file or test that will validate this>
```
Also add a concise reference to checklist.md in the task summary.

## Standard Handoff Block (between modes)
Write this block to active_context.md before switching modes:

```
=== HANDOFF @ YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS BST ===
From: <MODE_A> ‚Üí To: <MODE_B>
Scope: <precise goal to complete>
Inputs Read:
- goals/project_blueprint.md
- context/context_log.md (last 5)
- status/checklist.md (last 5)
Outputs To Produce:
- files changed under /src or /tests
- logs/status/context updates
Completion Signal: attempt_completion with summary
```
The orchestrator must also append a one-line summary to status/mode_switches.log.

## Default Behaviors When Files Are Missing
- Create context files with a header if absent:
  - context_log.md: "# Context Log"
  - active_context.md: "# Active Context"
  - future_context.md: "# Future Context"
- Create status files if absent:
  - checklist.md: "# Checklist"
  - test_outcomes.md: "# Test Outcomes"
  - mode_switches.log: "# Mode Switches"
- Create logs if absent:
  - task_history.log: "# Task History"
  - issues.md: "# Issues"
  - execution_trace.log: "# Execution Trace"
- Always log file creation in task_history.log and add a checklist entry.

## Per-Mode Memory I/O Contract (overview)
- Architect:
  - Read: goals/project_blueprint.md, context/active_context.md, status/checklist.md
  - Write: docs/plan.md, status/checklist.md (todo), context/* (present+future)
- Code:
  - Read: docs/plan.md, status/checklist.md (todos), context/active_context.md
  - Write: src/, tests/, docs/implementation.md, status/checklist.md (done), context/*
- Test:
  - Read: src/, tests/, context/active_context.md
  - Write: status/test_outcomes.md, status/checklist.md, context/*
- Debug:
  - Read: logs/issues.md, test_outcomes.md, context_log.md
  - Write: code fixes, checklist.md (done/blocked), context/*
- Report:
  - Read: checklist.md, implementation.md, project_blueprint.md, task_history.log, active_context.md
  - Write: reports/project_report.md, checklist.md (done), context/*
- Orchestrator:
  - Read: checklist.md, active_context.md
  - Write: new_task, status/mode_switches.log, context/*
- Emergency:
  - Read: logs/*
  - Write: snapshots/state_TIMESTAMP.md, logs/issues.md, context/*
Enforce these reads/writes for every action.

## Multi-module comprehension
- Use uniform block formats (ASSUMPTION, HANDOFF, ACTION) so any specialized mode can parse context quickly.
- Keep summaries short and file-linked to reduce token usage and improve precision.

## Safety and Rollback
- Before any high-risk operation (mass replace, external commands), snapshot state and note anchor timestamp in task_history.log.
- On two consecutive tool failures, enter emergency mode and write a causal trace.

## KPIs for Autonomy (tracked in reports/project_report.md)
- % actions without user questions
- Time-to-completion per task
- Rework rate after test or security review
- Snapshot frequency vs. drift events
